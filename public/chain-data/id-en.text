Who doesn’t feel warm inside when ordering a Happy Meal?<br><br>While the Big Mac is one of the most popular menu items in the brand’s home-country, in Indonesia, McDonald’s adapts its strategy to fit the Indonesian palate: where the firm favourite is PaNas: crispy chicken with rice. Still popular decades later; it’s the one that melts every Indonesians heart. Unique seasonal items such as the spicy chicken with Thai sweet chili sauce.<br><br>As a commitment to sustainability throughout its value chain, McDonald’s only sources high-quality beef from Australia, locally-sourced chicken, and an RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) certified palm oil.

Its buffet-style menu, which allows customers to choose their dishes, quickly became iconic in the local food scene. <br><br>Hoka Hoka Bento, as the restaurant chain was first known, means “steaming hot food in a box”. Fun fact: In 2013, the restaurant officially rebranded as HokBen, the endearing nickname customers had been using! The menu consists of home-style dishes such as chicken katsu, chicken or beef teriyaki, chicken or beef yakiniku and karaage. You can also order from the a la carte menu, which offers HokBen’s original chicken steak; for those who love food deliveries, the bento specials might be an easy choice. Though the menu is Japanese-inspired, HokBen has adapted its offering for local tastes: its sweet and extra spicy sambal is the perfect condiment for warm rice and chicken katsu. A local classic!<br><br>Even though there’s nothing else quite like HokBen in Indonesia, the restaurant is more than a Japanese fast food chain. With its mission to give back to the community, HokBen has launched various CSR programmes, such as blood donation drives, donations for the elderly, and scholarships for children in need. Its restaurants are also family focused, which is perhaps the reason why HokBen is such a go-to for people of all ages. </td><td class="s17" dir="ltr">Hokben Food Delivery Menu &amp; Promo | GrabFood ID</td><td class="s17" dir="ltr">Get your food delivered to your doorstep with 3 at GrabFood.

A decade later, it has expanded to many big cities throughout Indonesia with more than  160 outlets.<br><br>Knowing how much Indonesians love spicy food, the Richeese Factory started by selling spicy fried chicken (the “Fire” series) served with its signature cheese sauce. The cheese and chilli combo has since become a favourite among fried chicken lovers. When it comes to kick, you can choose from level 0 (Beginner level) to level 5 (Ultimate level). Some may get confused between the Fire Chicken and the Hot &amp; Spicy (H&amp;S) Chicken. Both are spicy, but the Fire series goes next level with BBQ and cheese sauces.<br><br>Meanwhile, those who don’t eat spicy food can enjoy the Richicken menu. This is fried chicken with a thin layer of crispy chicken skin — famous for its umami factor.

Slamet opened his first fried duck warung with his wife Baryatin in 1986. Their stall was located on a side road between Solo and Yogyakarta, with an investment of only Rp 10,000. It was hard work at first, but H. Slamet’s menu of fried duck, sambal korek, and rice finally became well known. What makes the duck extra special is the use of bebek afkir. Bebek Afkir has denser meat and thicker bones, which means they have to be cooked for longer. Hence, the spices are absorbed deeper into the meat. Before being cooked, H. Slamet also boiled the duck with water and herbs to make it more aromatic, then fried the duck until crispy. This is now the restaurant’s signature dish. <br><br>Now with 34 outlets across the archipelago, you can enjoy this legendary duck anywhere.
