The Texas Chicken menu features sumptuous fried chicken combo meals at great promo value -- and the best part of it all is, it&#39;s available for delivery too. <br><br>The best fried chicken in the world started in 1952 in the city of San Antonio, Texas with Jalapeño peppers making a debut as the first side on the menu. At the time, Texas Chicken was named after founder George W. Church Sr. - Church&#39;s Fried Chicken-To-Go. Today, Texas Chicken serves customers in more than 1,700 locations worldwide in 23 countries. When fast-food consisted of hot dogs and ice cream, the then Church&#39;s Fried Chicken-To-Go brought something else to the table -- freshly cooked, quality fried chicken. The brand went through a rebrand and became Texas Chicken in the 80s, but its consistency in plating up the best-fried chicken remains. <br><br>That&#39;s over six decades of the same great taste and crispy crunch. Between their signature Spicy or Original flavours, two things are the secret ingredients to these hand-battered Malaysian favourite: freshness and quality. Add on some of their buttery, crumbly honey biscuits, and you&#39;ve got a meal that&#39;s sure to satisfy those fried chicken cravings anytime. <br><br>But if you prefer a change of bite, order from their selection of crunchy burgers and wraps all made with never-frozen natural ingredients.

In the &#39;80s, Starbucks began adopting the Italian coffeehouse concept where cafés were a place of conversation and brought a sense of community. With this vision, Starbucks transformed itself to what it is today: the third place between work and home. <br><br>Today, the once humble little coffee shop has expanded to more than 17,400 stores in 60 countries. Starbucks is now known as the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.<br><br> Loyalists or frequent visitors often enjoy a menu of fresh, rich-brewed coffees, Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, a variety of cakes and pastries, and can purchase the Starbucks official merchandise.

The peri-peri sauce was in fact, first developed in nearby Mozambique and further refined in South Africa before being exported to Portuguese territories and mainland Portugal. <br><br>The duo bought over the restaurant and renamed it Nando&#39;s after Fernando&#39;s son, and the rest is history.
