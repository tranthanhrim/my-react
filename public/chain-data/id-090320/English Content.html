Where there is a gathering, there’s food and lots of sambal, usually delivered from a small eatery or warung nearby. This combination rarely fails to please, and is perhaps the reason why his business set the spicy “devil noodle” trend on fire in Indonesia.<br><br>Kober Mie Setan first opened in 2010 in Malang, and according to Aris Ardiansyah, it was the first to highlight extra spicy noodles in its menu. A plate of mie setan or “devil noodle”, the signature dish, consists of noodles, chillies, fried dumplings, sausage, veggies and chicken. A hot meal isn’t complete with something plain and crunchy on the side, so make sure you order the fried prawn balls — also a best seller — to take down the heat, or choose something mild from their nice selection of dim sum.<br><br>What set Mie Kober apart from other noodle houses when it launched was its spice level.

The battered part of the fried chicken is not too thick and not too crispy, with the seasoning richly working its way right through meat. The smashed chicken uses strong sambal bawang with a rich onion-garlic aroma, making it an appetising option. Meanwhile, the chicken steak uses a traditional brown sauce poured over battered smashed chicken. All are tasty, and popular with plenty to choose from, whatever the occasion.

Haji Slamet Raharjo was known among his neighbours in Solo to be a humble, simple man. In photos, he looked nothing like a man who had opened 34 outlets across Indonesia, serving mouthwatering fried duck for more than two decades.<br><br>H. Slamet opened his first fried duck warung with his wife Baryatin in 1986. Their stall was located on a side road between Solo and Yogyakarta, with an investment of only Rp 10,000. It was hard work at first, but H. Slamet’s menu of fried duck, sambal korek, and rice finally became well known. What makes the duck extra special is the use of bebek afkir. Bebek Afkir has denser meat and thicker bones, which means they have to be cooked for longer. Hence, the spices are absorbed deeper into the meat. Before being cooked, H. Slamet also boiled the duck with water and herbs to make it more aromatic, then fried the duck until crispy. This is now the restaurant’s signature dish. <br><br>Now with 34 outlets across the archipelago, you can enjoy this legendary duck anywhere.
